"What determines whether an algorithm can achieve the objective of the law?
(A) The quality of the law
(B) The judge
(C) The quality of the data 
(D) The law","  The quality of the data that a lawmaker relies on determines whether an algorithm can achieve the objective of the law.

(B) It was sufficient, but is not anymore 
(C) It was insufficient, but is now sufficient 
(D) No, it is not sufficient","  Based on the provided context, it can be argued that the Omnibus Directive is not sufficient to prevent online price personalization.

(C) No user is aware of how much data is gathered
(D) Most users are not aware of how much data is gathered","  Based on the context, the answer is (C) No user is aware of how much data is gathered.

Why should personalized laws be used?,"  Personalized laws can provide more accurate and relevant legal outcomes by taking into account the unique circumstances of each individual or situation. According to Anthony Casey and Anthony Niblett, ""the use of big data and algorithms to provide the contours of law will force lawmakers to address the question of what, precisely, is the objective of a particular law"" (Casey & Niblett, 2018). This can lead to a more efficient and effective legal system,"

"Where a seller has a 100% monopoly, what is ACPD likely to do?","  In a market where a seller has a 100% monopoly, ACPD is likely to result in higher prices for consumers. This is because the seller has complete control over the market and can charge whatever price they want, without fear of competition. According to Armstrong and Zhou's search deterrence history model, as the seller's market power increases, the consumer surplus decreases. Therefore, in a monopolistic market,"

This principle is rooted in Mill's belief in the importance of individual liberty and the minimization of"
How can online price discrimination or personalized pricing be described?,"  Online price discrimination, also known as personalized pricing, refers to the practice of charging different customers different prices for the same product or service based on their individual characteristics, such as their browsing history, purchase behavior, or demographic information.

What are they?","  According to the article, willingness-to-pay (WTP) is decomposed into two components: the utility from money lost (utility) and the money value of the good or service (money value). This decomposition is based on the work of Coker and Izaret (2021) and Vale (2020). The article explains that the utility component reflects the value that a consumer places on a good or service beyond its monetary value"
Why is the willingness to pay higher for some than for other people?,"  In the context of personalized pricing, the willingness to pay (WTP) of a rational individual is determined by the utility gained from the purchase (u(g)) and the utility lost from the price (u(l)). The maximum WTP for a person can be higher than for another person due to differences in their utility loss and gain from the purchase. For example, a person with a lower utility loss from an equivalent price paid may be willing to pay more than someone with"
What are examples of variables the consumer’s WTP depends on?,"  In the context of progressive pricing, the consumer's willingness to pay (WTP) depends on various factors. According to Schmalensee (1981), WTP can be influenced by the consumer's income, the price of related goods, and the consumer's expectations about future price changes. Similarly, Varian (1985) highlights that WTP can be affected by the consumer's preferences, the availability of subst"
Which methods are used to estimate WTP? Which one will be of concern to privacy on the internet?,"  There are several methods used to estimate WTP, including surveys, choice experiments, and econometric models. However, these methods are often subject to various limitations and biases, such as non-response bias, measurement error, and confounding variables. Moreover, even if WTP were a static variable, it would still be difficult to measure algorithmically as individuals themselves are often unaware of their own WTP. This means that any estimate of a consumer's WTP will necessarily have"

This can result in a more efficient use of resources and a better allocation of goods and services in the market. On the other hand,"
Is there a theoretical relationship between ex-ante market power and consumer outcomes?,"  According to the provided context, there is no discernible link between consumer outcomes and market power. In the Armstrong and Zhou search deterrence history model, consumer surplus is higher the greater is market power, while in Armstrong, consumer surplus is lower the greater is market power. Therefore, the level of market power is of little consequence for assessing whether ACPD is likely to harm consumers. (Source: Christopher Townley, Eric Morrison,"

Is first-degree price personalization considered Online Price personalization?,"  In the context of online personalized pricing, first-degree price discrimination refers to a pricing scheme where the price of a good or service does not depend on the quantity bought, but rather on the individual customer's willingness to pay.
